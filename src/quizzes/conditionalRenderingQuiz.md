1. What is "conditional rendering"? 
Conditional rendering is the rendering of DOM elements based on some condition defined 
by the programmer.

2. When would you use &&?
When I want to render an element or return a value if the condition on the left side of the operator is true


3. When would you use a ternary?
I should use a ternary when I want to render two different things based on if the preceeding condition is true or false



4. What if you need to decide between > 2 options on what to display?
I would use an if...else if...else statement or a switch statement
